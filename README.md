# Blackjack (in Python)

### Introduction
This is a version of a conventional Blackjack game in Python.
The game is designed for two players (one player vs. the computer).

### Game objective
Both the player and the computer can continue to request additional playing cards.
Both players should attempt to get a total score as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding 21.

### Card values
Aces are worth either 1 or 11.
All face cards are worth 10.
Any other card is worth its numerical value.
